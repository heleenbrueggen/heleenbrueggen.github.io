The title of the thesis is Multilevel Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations through Bayesian Additive Regression Trees and is supervised by Thom Volker, Hanne Oberman and Gerko Vink from Utrecht University. It is expected to be finished in May 2024.\nFor now, you can find the research report for this thesis project and associated LateX file here.\n\n\nReproducible Research Project\nFor the course Markup languages and Reproducible Research Heleen created a reproducible research project. You can download a local copy of the repository here. This Github repository contains the file that is fully reproducible when running the script and is licensed.\n\n\nR-package\nAgain, for the course Markup languages and Reproducible Research Heleen created simple R-package which is availabele on Github. The package is called datageneration and can be installed using the following code: devtools::install_github(\"heleenbrueggen/datageneration\")\nThe package includes versioning, a license, tests, and a reference with DOI that can be found in the Github repository.\nThe package generates a simple data set containing normally distributed variables with a specified mean and standard deviation. From those variables a dependent variables y is created assuming a linear relationship between the variables. The user can specify the number of variables, the mean and standard deviation of the variables, and the amount of observations."

    "text": "Currently, Heleen Brüggen is a PhD candidate at the UMC Utrecht at the Julius Center in the department of Data Science & Biostatistics. Her research focuses on the prediction paradox in AI prediction models in healthcare. She is supervised by prof. Ewout Steyerberg, Dr. Maarten van Smeden, Dr. Wouter van Amsterdam, and Dr. Oisin Ryan.\nShe obtained her Master’s degree in Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences at Utrecht University in 2024. Her Master’s thesis focused on implementing Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) models in multilevel multiple imputation through chained equations. Furthermore, she holds a bachelor’s degree in Sociology from Utrecht University, which she completed in 2022.\nNext to her academic background, Heleen also holds a Bachelor of Music in Classical Violin Performance from the Conservatory of Utrecht, studying with acclaimed Carla Leurs. She has performed in various orchestras and ensembles, including the Dutch National Youth Orchestra (NJO) and the VU-orkest.\nIn her free time, Heleen enjoys sight-reading chamber music, drawing, reading, gaming and photography."
